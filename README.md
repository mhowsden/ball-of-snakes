ball-of-snakes
==============

What is this man?  A heap of diseases, which, through his spirit, reach out into the world:
there they want to catch their prey.

What is this man?  A ball of wild snakes, which rarely enjoy rest from each other: so they
go forth singly and seek prey in the world.

*-Zarathustra*
